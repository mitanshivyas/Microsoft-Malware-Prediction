# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

The LightGBM model predicts a numerical value for ‘HasDetections’, which gives a percentage of how likely the machine is to get infected by the malware.

## Project Description

Malware or virus is a threat to any computer or machine which can damage the data, or even steal the information stored causing a lot of loss in revenue. The ability to predict if the system is soon going to be attacked by malware is of utmost importance to prevent adverse effects. The prediction of the malware attack is one of the challenging problems for industry and academia. The main objective of this project is to predict the probability of a Windows machine of getting compromised by malware based on various properties of the machine.

In order to decrease the memory consumption, we created a function to alter the datatypes of the features of the dataset. If the feature’s data can be stored in a smaller datatype than that of the existing one, we change it. For e.g., if the feature has datatype as ‘int16’ but its records can be stored in ‘int8’, then we changed the data type of that feature from ‘int16’ to ‘int8’. This functionality helped us a lot as memory usage dropped to an average of 55% of the initial usage.

## Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* lighgbm
* re

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
Otherwise, you could execute the code on Google Colaboratory.

## Run

In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```
ipython notebook Malware_Detection_LightGBM_Implementation.ipynb
```
or

```
jupyter notebook Malware_Detection_LightGBM_Implementation.ipynb
```

or open with Juoyter Lab

```
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

or else download and upload the file on Google Colaboratoty.

## Data

The dataset is taken from Kaggle and was originally presented by Microsoft with the purpose of hosting a competition to determine the probability of a Windows Machine getting infected by various families of malware. The dataset was originally 8.47 GB in size, and it consisted of 8.9 Million rows and 82 features which consisted of 27 numerical features and 56 categorical features. The target label for us is ‘HasDetections’.
